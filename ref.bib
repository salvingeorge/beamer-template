	abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach for the autonomous localization of radioactive sources in complex unknown environments. The approach contains two stages: a source tracking stage for detailed source term estimation (STE) with recent measurements, and a relocation stage for transiting the robot to another sub-area after the current one is ruled out. The STE algorithm in conjunction with the convex polyhedrons extracted from the environment enables our method to be deployed in realistic scenarios with complex obstacles, which are often unfeasible for existing methods. The source confirmation algorithm in the relocation stage considerably accelerates the overall processing, improving the time efficiency in finding the radioactive sources. In both simulations and experiments, this approach is able to precisely localize at the success rate of 90\% within an average of less than 13 measurements in 7 different environments, which is impressive when compared to the traditional STE which can hardly achieve an accurate estimation in most cases.},

Under such circumstances, it is of paramount importance to determine the location and release rate of the hazardous source to forecast the future harm it may cause and employ methods to minimize the disturbance. In this paper, a sensor data collection strategy is proposed whereby an autonomous mobile sensor is guided to address such a problem with a high degree of accuracy and in a short amount of time. First, the parameters of the release source are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach. The most informative manoeuvre from the set of possible choices is then selected using the concept of maximum entropy sampling. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and the number of measurements required.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new approach for Simultaneous Localization of UAV and RF Sources (SLUS) is proposed. In the UAV-based localization of RF sources, such as a cell phone in a search and rescue mission, the UAV navigation errors are a significant source of localization error. Although the use of GPS can reduce UAV localization error significantly resulting in more accurate RF source localization, however, if the GPS is not available temporarily or permanently, the accuracy of UAV-based localization decreases rapidly. The proposed approach solves these two connected problems, i.e. UAV localization and RF source localization, simultaneously to decrease the error of UAV position estimation and the error of RF sources localization. The prediction of UAV pose is done in parallel to RF source position prediction first. Then the predicted states are augmented and the augmented predicted state information is corrected in SLUS using the range and bearing observations. The simulation results show that this method can reduce RF source's position estimation error and prevent the divergence of UAV navigation in latitude and longitude channels. In the other words, the RF features available in the environment can be used to improve the UAV navigation.},

In this work, we propose reinforcement learning as a data-driven approach to conduct radiation detection tasks with no human intervention. A simulated radiation environment is constructed, and a convolutional neural network-based double Q-learning algorithm is built and tested for radiation source detection tasks. Simulation results show that the double Q-learning algorithm can reliably navigate the detector and reduce the searching time by at least 44\% compared with traditional uniform search methods and gradient search methods.},

	abstract = {Locating lost radioactive sources quickly, precisely, and safely is very important in emergency responses of lost radioactive source accidents. This paper describes a source localization approach using an independently developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) radiation monitoring system, which uses a specialized source localization algorithm. Once a radiation anomaly spot is found on the ground, an L×L (m2) square area around the anomaly spot defined as suspicious region is selected to perform an accurate source localization. Then, the UAV radiation monitoring instrument is dispatched to hover at some scheduled detection positions within the suspicious region for radiation measurements. After the last hover finished, the actual source position is calculated by the source localization algorithm program in real time. The source localization algorithm was developed on the basis of the inverse-square law and statistical methods. Five critical factors of the algorithm that may lead to errors in localization such as the meshing number in calculations, the size of the suspicious region, the number of the detection positions, the distribution of the detection positions, and the coverage range of the detection positions were studied by using measurement data from Monte Carlo simulations. Subsequently, the approach was experimentally verified for a 3.7 × 107 Bq 131I source localization. Three experimental scenes were applied such as the source on the grass, next to a tree, and in a puddle. Different distributions of the detection positions and different numbers of the detection positions were studied. The best localization distance error was 30 cm within a 10 × 10 m2 suspicious region, and the calculation time was not more than 0.1 s after a total survey flight of 5 min.},

Given a searching region where some information about the target is known but uncertain (i.e. location and dynamics), and a searching agent with constrained dynamics, we provide two decision making algorithms that optimizes the agent actions to find the target in a minimum time. The problem is faced as a discrete optimization: the actions and the sensor are discrete, and the target probabilistic model is described over a graph, where each vertex contains the target's location probability information and each edge defines the agent possible actions. We revisit the mathematical model of the optimal search problem and we propose a novel approach to include the time into the decision making by reinterpreting it as a maximum discounted time reward problem. The optimal decision plan for the agent is obtained by solving this non convex discrete problem using the cross entropy method. By performing statistical simulations we show how the target is found in minimum time.},

	abstract = {An autonomous search for sources of gamma radiation in an outdoor environment is a domain suitable for the deployment of a heterogeneous robotic team, consisting of an Unmanned Aerial (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground (UGV) Vehicle. The UAV is convenient for fast mapping of the area and identifying regions of interest, whereas the UGV can perform highly accurate localization. It is assumed that the regions of interest are identified by the UAV during an initial reconnaissance, while performing a simple motion pattern. This paper proposes a path planning algorithm for the UGV, which guarantees accurate source localization in multiple preselected regions and minimizes the total path length. The problem is formulated as the Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP) defined for discrete sets of suitable maneuvers (circular arcs), ensuring source localization in the given regions. The problem is successfully solved by a modified version of the state of the art GTSP solver, Generalized Large Neighborhood Search with Arcs (GLNSarc). Apart from adapting the GLNS, other aspects of the planning task are addressed: problem discretization and informed sampling of valid circular arcs, variants of weighting the nonrestricted trajectory segments between the arcs and postprocessing of the discretely planned trajectory in the continuous domain.},

The number of genes in one chromosome is function of the number of obstacles in the map. Therefore, we used a fixed length chromosome.

	abstract = {Mobile robots have been employed extensively in various environments which involve automation and remote monitoring. In order to perform their tasks successfully, navigation from one point to another must be done while avoiding obstacles present in the area. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of two approaches in path planning, specifically, probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and genetic algorithm (GA). Two maps, one simple and one complex, were used to compare their performances. In PRM, a map was initially loaded and followed by identifying the number of nodes. Then, initial and final positions were defined. The algorithm, then, generated a network of possible connections of nodes between the initial and final positions. Finally, the algorithm searched this network of connected nodes to return a collision-free path. In GA, a map was also initially loaded followed by selecting the GA parameters. These GA parameters were subjected to explorations as to which set of values will fit the problem. Then, initial and final positions were also defined. Associated cost included the distance or the sum of segments for each of the generated path. Penalties were introduced whenever the generated path involved an obstacle. Results show that both approaches navigated in a collision-free path from the set initial position to the final position within the given environment or map. However, there were observed advantages and disadvantages of each method. GA produces smoother paths which contributes to the ease of navigation of the mobile robots but consumes more processing time which makes it difficult to implement in realtime navigation. On the other hand, PRM produces the possible path in a much lesser amount of time which makes it applicable for more reactive situations but sacrifices smoothness of navigation. The presented advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches show that it is important to select the proper algorithm for path planning suitable for a particular application.},

The ability to detect and localize radiation sources is essential for ensuring nuclear safety, security, and surveillance. To enable the autonomous localization of radiation sources, the robot must have the ability to automatically determine the next location for gamma ray measurement instead of following a predefined path. The number of incident events is approximated to be the squared inverse proportional to the distance between the radiation source and the detector. Therefore, the closer the distance to the source, the shorter the time required to obtain the same radiation counts measured by the detector. Hence, the proposed method is designed to reduce this distance to a position where a sufficient number of gamma-ray events can be obtained; then, a path to surround the radiation sources is generated. The proposed method generates this path by performing principal component analysis based on the results obtained from previous measurements. Both simulations and actual experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically generate a measurement path and accurately localize radiation sources.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient approach to the multiple source localization and contour mapping problem of radiation fields using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A typical radiation field originating from a single hotspot can be generated by three spatial distributions of sources; scattered, clustered and biased. Of these, the clustered sources are relatively easy to localize, because the sources are located in a close proximity to the center of distribution. In other cases, it is not very straightforward, because, when multiple radiating sources generate a hotspot in a cumulative manner, sources do not coincide with the hotspot position. Regardless of our knowledge about the hotspot position, we attempt to solve the multiple radiation localization problem in two steps: the Region Of Interest (ROI) selection and the source localization. Existing algorithms eventually explore whole area, causing the problem of excessive use of UAV resources. We therefore propose a framework to reduce ROI in a radiation field that not only optimizes the resources but also increases the localization accuracy. For the source localization process, two different methods are employed interchangeably. Those methods are called the Hough Transform and the Variational Bayesian, adaptively selected with a switching technique and the overall performance is evaluated by balancing between the localization accuracy and the required exploration. In favor of the optimization, the prediction model defines the type of sources in a way that the adaptive switching methodology can converge to an optimal solution by selecting an appropriate method. Thus, the proposed framework enables the UAV to accurately localize the radiation sources in a fast manner. In order to verify the validity and the performance of the proposed strategies, we performed extensive numerical experiments with different numbers of sources and their positions. Our empirical results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms existing individual approaches.},

	abstract = {Mobile robots have been employed extensively in various environments which involve automation and remote monitoring. In order to perform their tasks successfully, navigation from one point to another must be done while avoiding obstacles present in the area. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of two approaches in path planning, specifically, probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and genetic algorithm (GA). Two maps, one simple and one complex, were used to compare their performances. In PRM, a map was initially loaded and followed by identifying the number of nodes. Then, initial and final positions were defined. The algorithm, then, generated a network of possible connections of nodes between the initial and final positions. Finally, the algorithm searched this network of connected nodes to return a collision-free path. In GA, a map was also initially loaded followed by selecting the GA parameters. These GA parameters were subjected to explorations as to which set of values will fit the problem. Then, initial and final positions were also defined. Associated cost included the distance or the sum of segments for each of the generated path. Penalties were introduced whenever the generated path involved an obstacle. Results show that both approaches navigated in a collision-free path from the set initial position to the final position within the given environment or map. However, there were observed advantages and disadvantages of each method. GA produces smoother paths which contributes to the ease of navigation of the mobile robots but consumes more processing time which makes it difficult to implement in realtime navigation. On the other hand, PRM produces the possible path in a much lesser amount of time which makes it applicable for more reactive situations but sacrifices smoothness of navigation. The presented advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches show that it is important to select the proper algorithm for path planning suitable for a particular application.},

	abstract = {Most of the existing path planning algorithms require a prior global map. Although there have been some algorithms proposed for unknown environments, they can only deal with those which just have several hidden obstacles in a roughly known global map. In order to improve the efficiency of robot’s path planning without prior global maps, this paper proposes a Convolutionally Evaluated Gradient First Search (CE-GFS) path planning algorithm. It allows the robot to collect environmental information and complete path planning simultaneously. Firstly, the Gradient First Search (GFS) algorithm is proposed based on the gradient score parameter, with which the conventional cost function is replaced. The GFS can adapt to any moving direction through the environmental information surrounding the mobile robot and computing the gradient score parameter. Secondly, CE-GFS path planning algorithm is proposed based on GFS and convolutional evaluation method. The CE-GFS helps the robots to evaluate the efficiency of the global path and get global perception ability, so that they are prevented from going astray, which can significantly improve the efficiency of path planning. Finally, several simulation tests and field tests have been carried out. The test results show that convolutional evaluation improves the efficiency of CE-GFS by 86.94\% on average compared with GFS at the price of 0.18\% decrease in path planning success rate. Moreover, the time cost of the proposed CE-GFS algorithm is 42.18\% less than that of FAR-Planner in some special cases.},

	abstract = {Smart environmental monitoring has gained prominence, where target localization is of utmost importance. Employing UAVs for localization tasks is appealing owing to their low-cost, lightweight, and high maneuverability. However, UAVs lack the autonomy of decision-making if met with uncertain situations. Therefore, reinforcement learning (RL) can introduce intelligence to UAVs, where they learn to act based on the presented situation. Existing works focus on UAV trajectory optimization, navigation, and target tracking. These methods are application-specific and cannot be adapted to localization tasks since they require prior knowledge of the target. Moreover, the current RL-based autonomous target localization systems are lacking since- 1) they must keep track of all visited locations and their corresponding readings, 2) they require retraining when encountering new environments, and 3) they are not scalable since the agent's movement is limited to slow speeds and for specific environments. Therefore, this work proposes a data-driven UAV target localization system based on Q-learning, which employs tabular methods to learn the optimal policy. Deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to enhance the RL model and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The proposed models enable smart decision-making, where the sensory information gathered by the UAV is exploited to produce the best action. Moreover, the UAV movement is modeled based on motion physics, where the actions correspond to linear velocities and heading angles. The proposed approach is compared with different benchmarks, where the results indicate that a more efficient, scalable, and adaptable localization is achieved, irrespective of the environment or source characteristics, without retraining.},

In the case of a single mobile radiation detector, there are numerous challenges to overcome such as weak source intensity, multiple sources, background radiation, and the presence of obstructions, i.e., a non-convex environment. In this work, we investigate the sequential decision making capability of deep reinforcement learning in the nuclear source search context. A novel neural network architecture (RAD-A2C) based on the advantage actor critic (A2C) framework and a particle filter gated recurrent unit for localization is proposed. Performance is studied in a randomized 20×20 m convex and non-convex simulation environment across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)s for a single detector and single source. RAD-A2C performance is compared to both an information-driven controller that uses a bootstrap particle filter and to a gradient search (GS) algorithm. We find that the RAD-A2C has comparable performance to the information-driven controller across SNR in a convex environment. The RAD-A2C far outperforms the GS algorithm in the non-convex environment with greater than 95\% median completion rate for up to seven obstructions.},

	abstract = {The localization of hazardous sources (e.g. poisonous gas sources) is an important task regarding the security of human society. To find the unknown source in time, various autonomous source searching methods have mushroomed and been employed over the past decade. This paper designs a fresh source searching approach, namely particle clustering-deep Q-network, PC-DQN, which applies the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques as a source searching approach for the first time. Specifically, the search process is formulated as the partially observable Markov decision process, then converted into the Markov decision process based on the belief state (represented by the particle filter). PC-DQN leverages the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to extract the feature of belief state, and employ the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to find the optimal policy for the source searching task. Through the comparison with two baseline methods (i.e. RANDOM and Entrotaxis algorithm) under various experimental conditions, the viability of our proposed PC-DQN is testified. Results explicitly reveal that the success rate of the PC-DQN maintains at a high level (beyond 99.6\%) in all scenarios in this paper, and the mean search step shows evident superiority over baseline methods in most scenarios. Significantly, we also introduce the transfer learning concept to reuse the well-trained Q-network into new scenarios. These findings show important implications of the DRL-based approach as an alternative and more effective source searching approach.},

Tracking a moving target using a camera mounted on a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft is considered, but the control formulation is not specific to this choice of sensor or estimation task. A control formulation is developed which minimizes the entropy of an estimate distribution over a receding horizon subject to stochastic non-linear models for both the target motion and sensors. Previous similar work has been restricted to either a stationary target, a horizon of length one, or Gaussian estimates. The prediction of conditional entropy is shown to be inherently complex, and a computationally efficient sequential Monte Carlo method is developed. The entropy prediction depends on this Monte Carlo method as well as a novel approach for entropy calculation in the context of particle filtering.

It illustrates that these filters are powerful tools that can robustly estimate the state of the robot and its environment and that they are also well-suited to making decisions about how to navigate in order to minimize a robot's uncertainty about its own position and the state of the environment. They offer a series of attractive capabilities, including the ability to deal with non-Gaussian distributions and nonlinear sensor and motion models.

Among all types of sensors, RGB camera is widely used in these applications as it can offer rich visual contents with relatively lowcost, and using a single image to perform depth estimation has become one of the main focuses in resent research works. However, prior works usually rely on highly complicated computation and power-consuming GPU to achieve such task; therefore, we focus on developing a real-time light-weight system for depth prediction in this paper. Based on the well-known encoder-decoder architecture, we propose a supervised learningbased CNN with detachable decoders that produce depth predictions with different scales. We also formulate a novel logdepth loss function that computes the difference of predicted depth map and ground truth depth map in log space, so as to increase the prediction accuracy for nearby locations. To train our model efficiently, we generate depth map and semantic segmentation with complex teacher models. Via a series of ablation studies and experiments, it is validated that our model can efficiently performs real-time depth prediction with only 0.32M parameters, with the best trained model outperforms previous works on KITTI dataset for various evaluation matrices.},

	abstract = {The detection of radioactive materials has become a critical issue for environmental services, public health, and national security. This paper proposes a spatial statistical method to detect and localize a hidden radioactive source. Based on a detection system of multiple radiation detectors, the statistical model assumes that the counts of radiation particles received by those detectors are spatially distributed of Poisson distribution, and each comprises a signal and a background. By considering the physical law of signal degradation with distance, the paper provides a numerical method to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of the strength and location of the source. Based on these estimates, a likelihood ratio statistic is used to test the existence of the source. Because of the special properties of the model, the test statistic does not converge asymptotically to the standard chi-square distribution. Thus a bootstrap method is proposed to compute the p-value in the test. The simulation results show that the proposed method is efficient for detecting and localizing the hidden radioactive source.},
