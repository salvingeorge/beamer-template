\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Radioactivity is a fundamental aspect of life, essential for heating the Earth's core and enabling life to develop.
  \item Discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896, radioactivity has advanced significantly and is crucial to modern society. \cite{doe}
  \item Radioactivity involves atoms seeking stability by emitting particles or energy.
  \item Radioactive materials can be misused for harmful purposes, necessitating detection and securing to prevent contamination.
  % \item Project Focus: Enhance UAV localization and path planning for detecting radioactive sources, develop a simulation and evaluation framework, compare localization methods, and address challenges like particle attenuation and scattering in detection.
  \item Project Focus: Identify a method or combination of methods that will efficiently and accurately localize radioactive sources with minimal computational cost and also without the need for exploring the full search space.
\end{itemize}

% \frametitle{Relevance of the topic}

% \begin{itemize}
  
%   % \item Since 1993, there have been 4243 confirmed incidents of radioactive materials being lost or stolen, with 52\% occurring during authorized transports.
%   % \item It is also worth noting that 87\% of the theft incidents for malicious intents remain undetected. \{Source: IAEA Incident and Trafficking Database}
%   % \item Therefore, the necessity for a tool that helps to source the radioactive materials is of utmost importance.

      \begin{itemize}
        \item The results of this project will be beneficial to the security agencies and law enforcement agencies to detect the radioactive sources in a timely manner.
        \item This localization of the radioactive sources can be useful to the nuclear power plants to detect the leakages in the reactor.
        \item Localizing the radioactive sources prevents the contamination of the environment and the food chain.
